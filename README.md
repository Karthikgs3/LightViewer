# LightViewer

LightViewer is a mobile application developed using Flutter, leveraging AWS services for secure and efficient document storage—similar to traditional document management apps, but with a unique twist.

## 🔐 What's Unique?
**Semi-Verification Feature**:
A standout functionality of LightViewer is its "semi-verification" system. It allows any user (typically an admin) to sign a file with their personal key and share it through any platform. The receiving party (client) can then verify the file's authenticity and integrity, ensuring trust and security in file transactions.
